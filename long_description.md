This particular photo-masking application is about a square bowl and a potter’s wheel pivot. Both objects were found in Girdi Bazar, which is part of an Iron Age settlement complex (ca. 1200-600 BCE) located in the Kurdish Autonomous Region of Iraq, province of Sulaymaniyah. The objects were excavated in Autumn 2017 during archaeological investigations carried out by LMU Munich’s Ancient History Department, which has been running the excavation since 2015. According to the excavators, the square bowl served as a basis for the wheel pivot which was placed in it. On the pivot a wooden wheel was rotated, on which the clay was fashioned into a pot. This mechanism is known as a potter’s slow- wheel. With this crowd-sourcing project we are asking for your help to assist with the 3D documentation of one of these tools.
